The Gateway Server acts as the single entry point for all microservices, handling request routing based on configuration managed centrally through Spring Cloud Config. Important: All route paths and proxy settings must be configured exclusively in the spring-configuration repository using configuration files (e.g., gateway-server.yml), which ensures consistency across environments and allows hot updates to routes without rebuilding the application.
